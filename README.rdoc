= Hubstats
Github statistics 
This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

= Authentication
Hubstats needs github credentials to access your repo's pull requests, these can be setup in one of two ways.
== Environment Variables
Hubstats uses OAUTH access tokens stored in ENV["GITHUB_API_TOKEN"] or for Application Authentication in ENV["CLIENT_ID"] and ENV["CLIENT_SECRET"]

== octokit.yml
Hubstats can also pull credentials from a YAML file stored in your app's config folder.
Run rails generate hubstats:install from your app's directory to set it up.

= Configuration
Hubstats needs to know what repos for it to watch. You can set it to watch either an entire organization or a list of specific repos.
These are set in octokit.yml, so if you used environment variables for Authentication, generate the octokit.yml using rails generate hubstats:install.

= Setup
Run rake hubstats:setup to run the necessary migrations and start pulling data from github.
